# 3.1. Course Design Process

The primary objective of the course design process is to lay out the foundation of course development process by a very effective training outcomes and learning outcomes that would define the effective teaching-learning activities and assessment activities.

#### Table 5. Course design process
| Inputs |	Outputs |
|--------|----------|
| Needs Analysis\ National and international standards, as applicable\ Client’s specific requirements | Training outcomes\ Training outcomes\ Learning outcomes\ Course outline (initial)\ Course timeline (initial)\ Description of teaching-learning activities\ Description of assessment activities|

# 3.3	Writing the Training Outcome

The training outcome **must**:

- Define the overall outcome(s) upon completion of the training course or program;
- Describe to the trainees what they are going to learn throughout the course or program duration; and
- Clearly defined and focus on the observed activity.

# 3.4.	Writing the Learning Outcome

The learning outcome must:

- Reflect what the learner must be able to do from the topic discussion;
- Measurable and capable of being assessed;
- Learner-centric; and
- Derived from the training outcomes.

## 3.4.1. Anatomy of the training objective and learning outcome

Training objective and learning outcome must be constructed in the manner as shown below.

![Anatomy of a training/course outcome](../img/anatomy_outcome.png)

#### Table 6. Difference between training outcomes and learning outcomes
| Training outcomes | Learning outcomes |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Overall outcomes upon completion of the training course or program |Specific outcomes upon completion of the topic |
| Define assessment method and standards | Define the assessment criteria |
| Attainment is measured by summative assessment | Attainment is measured by both formative and summative assessments |

## 3.4.2. Verb taxonomy

The *taxonomy of verbs* refers to the classification thinking skills required to be demonstrated at the end of the teaching-learning activity (outcome). It is important during the design and development process that the verb used is appropriate to its taxonomy vis-à-vis the required competences, KUPs and other requirements as determined during the **Needs Analysis**.

The following tables outline the verbs that can be used in constructing the training outcomes and learning outcomes. The list is not exhaustive; therefore, the course designer and developer must be warned of limiting himself or herself into them.

#### Table 7. Verb taxonomy

| Order of thinking skills[^1] | List of verbs | Explanation |

## 3.4.3.	Verbs and phrases to be avoided

The following verbs and phrases **MUST NOT** be used in constructing learning outcomes because they are vague, hard to measure, and or unobservable:

- Acquainted with
- Awareness of
- Be familiar with
- Capable of
- Comprehend
- Conceptualize
- Conscious of
- Experience
- Feel
- Knowledge of
- Knowledgeable about
- Memorize
- Realize
- Recognize
- Think
- Understand
 
## 3.4.4.	Characteristics of a good learning outcome

The mnemonic **SMART (TT)** can be used in determining the quality of the learning outcome as adapted from Blanchard, K., & Johnson, S. (1981): 

- **Speak to the learner** – learning outcome should address what the learner will know or be able to do at the completion of the course;
- **Measurable** – learning outcome must indicate how the learning will be assessed;
- **Applicable** – learning outcome should emphasise ways in which the learner is likely to use the knowledge or skills gained;
- **Realistic** – all learners who complete the activity or course satisfactorily should be able to demonstrate the knowledge or skills addressed in the outcome;
- **Time-bound** – the learning outcome should set a deadline by which knowledge or skills should be acquired;
- **Transparent** – should be easily understood by the learner; and
- **Transferable** – should address the knowledge and skills that will be used by the learner in the wide variety of contexts.

The following also indicates the qualities of a good learning outcome:

- **Specific** – the learning outcome is clear on what is the actual performance to be expected; learning outcome does not combine two performances;
- **Realistic** – not aspirational; and
- Indicates **useful** mode of assessment.
