# 2.1. PURPOSE

This section introduces the course design and development process and provides the general picture involved. Main phases of the design and development and the key documents to be produced are outlined.

For this and the succeeding sections, it is best practice to list the targeted audience such as shown below:

> This section is generally helpful for the following:
> - Management
> - Course designers and developers

# 2.2. CONCEPTUALISING A COURSE

There are different valid ways of which a course can be conceptualized. The table below outlines some of the approaches that any organization can use in conceptualizing a course. These approaches are non-excusive and work best when blended, as appropriate.

#### Table 3. Approaches to conceptualising a course

| Approach | Main proponents | Description  |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Client’s request | Management, Marketing |Specific needs of a client as learned from encounters with key personnel (e.g. Training Director/Manager, Crewing Manager) |
| International and national standards | Training Department | Introduction and changes in the international and national standards |
| Demand-supply analysis | Training Department, Marketing  | Analysis of the training demand based on the supply gap of training providers, trainees’ specific needs |
| Competency gap analysis | Training Department | Analysis of the gap in the knowledge, skills and competence (in general) of the learning clients due to technological, socio-economic and other factors |
  
### Needs Analysis

A “Needs Analysis” documents the initial phase of the course design and development which is used  in order to determine whether the undertaking is worthwhile considering the limited resources or in choosing which training courses or program is to prioritise.

The Needs Analysis must determine the following as inputs during the initial planning phase of course design and development.

•	Training outcomes
•	Learning outcomes
•	Intended audience or learners
•	Expected training or course duration
•	Key topics
•	Recommended references

# 2.3. PHASES OF COURSE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

The **Needs Analysis**, as part of the initial planning, is the first stage of course design and development. The succeeding stages are cyclical that only stopped when agreed that the course becomes OBSOLETE due to external and internal developments (such as issues in profitability and changes in standards.)

The figure below shows the phases of the course design and development.

The table shown below indicates the phases in the design and development of a course including the responsible person(s) and expected output(s).

#### Table 4. Phases of course design and development

| Phase |	Responsible person(s) |	Output(s) |
|-------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Initial planning | Training Director, Management, Marketing | Initial course description |
| 1. Course design | Course designer, Training Director | Training outcomes, learning outcomes, course outline, course timeline |
|  2. Course development | Course developer, Training Director |	Course plan, assessment and instructional materials |
| 3. Course finalization | Training director, Course developer, Management | Course package |
| 4. Implementation | Instructor, Training Director |	Remarks for enhancement |
| 5.	Course evaluation | Training Director |	Revised course package |
