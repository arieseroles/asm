A **Course Design and Development Manual** prescribes the policies and procedures in the design and development of courses and training programs.

Like any other manual, it must be reviewed and revised accordingly and distributed in formats suitable for the organization (although, controlled soft-copies in DOCX, PDF, WIKI, etc. is, I think, most effective). The organization needs also to have a *Document Control Policies and Procedures* detailing the restrictions in accessing, editing, and sharing of the document. An example of document access and restriction is shown in Table 1 below.

#### Table 1: Document access and restrictions

| Sections  | Document classification | Remarks |

| Section N | PUBLIC                  |         |
